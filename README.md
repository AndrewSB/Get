# Get

[![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platforms-iOS%20%7C%20macOS%20%7C%20watchOS%20%7C%20tvOS%20%7C%20Linux-4E4E4E.svg?colorA=28a745)](#installation)

A modern Swift web API client built using async/await.

```swift
let client = APIClient(baseURL: URL(string: "https://api.github.com"))

// Using the client directly
let user: User = try await client.send(.get("/user")).value
try await client.send(.post("/user/emails", body: ["kean@example.com"]))

// Using the API definition generated with CreateAPI
let repos = try await client.send(Paths.users("kean").repos.get)
```

Get provides a clear and convenient API for modelling network requests using `Request<Response>` type. And its `APIClient` makes it easy to execute these requests and decode the responses.

The client uses `URLSession` for networking and provides complete access to all the `URLSession` APIs.

```swift
// In addition to `APIClientDelegate`, you can also override any methods
// from `URLSessionDelegate` family of APIs.
let client = APIClient(baseURL: URL(string: "https://api.github.com")) {
    $0.sessionDelegate = ...
}

// You can also provide task-specific delegates and easily change any of
// the `URLRequest` properties before the request is sent.
let delegate: URLSessionDataDelegate = ...
let response = try await client.send(Paths.user.get, delegate: delegate) {
    $0.cachePolicy = .reloadIgnoringLocalCacheData
}
```

In addition to sending quick requests, it also supports downloads to files, uploads from files, authentication, auto-retries, logging, and more.

## Integrations

### Pulse

You can easily add logging to your API client using [Pulse](https://github.com/kean/Pulse). It requests a single line to setup.

```swift
let client = APIClient(baseURL: URL(string: "https://api.github.com")) {
    $0.sessionDelegate = PulseCore.URLSessionProxyDelegate()
}
```

With Pulse, you can inspect logs directly on your device â€“ and it supports _all_ Apple platforms. And you can share the logs at any time and view them on a big screen using [Pulse Pro](https://kean.blog/pulse/guides/pulse-pro).

### CreateAPI

With [CreateAPI](https://github.com/kean/CreateAPI), you can take your backend OpenAPI spec, and generate all of the response entities and even requests for Get `APIClient`.

```swift
generate api.github.yaml --output ./OctoKit --module "OctoKit"
```

> Check out [App Store Connect Swift SDK](https://github.com/AvdLee/appstoreconnect-swift-sdk) that starting with v2.0 uses [CreateAPI](https://github.com/kean/CreateAPI) for code generation.

### Other Extensions

Get is a lean framework with a lot of flexibility and customization points. It makes it very easy to learn and use, but for certain features, you'll need to install additional modules.

- [Mocker](https://github.com/WeTransfer/Mocker) â€“ mocking network requests for testing purposes
- [URLQueryEncoder](https://github.com/CreateAPI/URLQueryEncoder) â€“ URL query encoder with `Codable` support
- [MultipartFormDataKit](https://github.com/Kuniwak/MultipartFormDataKit) â€“ adds support for `multipart/form-data`
- [NaiveDate](https://github.com/CreateAPI/NaiveDate) â€“ working with dates without timezones
